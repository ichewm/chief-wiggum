--------------------------- MODULE WorkerLifecycle ---------------------------
(*
 * TLA+ formal model of Chief Wiggum's worker lifecycle state machine.
 *
 * Faithfully encodes every transition from config/worker-lifecycle.json.
 * Transient states (fix_completed, resolved) are skipped atomically --
 * chains collapse into a single transition. merge_conflict is modeled
 * as a real state since it persists until a conflict.* event fires.
 *
 * EFFECT-STATE MODELING (Quick Win #1):
 * Models side effects as explicit state variables to catch partial-effect
 * and crash-recovery bugs:
 *   - inConflictQueue: whether task is queued for conflict resolution
 *   - worktreeState: worktree lifecycle (absent/present/cleaning)
 *   - lastError: error category from last failure
 *
 * CRASH/RESTART MODELING (Quick Win #2):
 * Includes Crash action that can interrupt running states, leaving effects
 * partially applied. StartupReset actions model orchestrator restart recovery.
 *
 * Designed for Apalache symbolic model checking (type annotations, CInit).

\* =========================================================================
\* Safety Invariants
\* =========================================================================

\* TypeInvariant: all variables within declared domains
TypeInvariant ==
    /\ state \in AllStates
    /\ mergeAttempts \in 0..MAX_MERGE_ATTEMPTS + 1
    /\ recoveryAttempts \in 0..MAX_RECOVERY_ATTEMPTS + 1
    /\ kanban \in KanbanValues
    /\ inConflictQueue \in BOOLEAN
    /\ worktreeState \in WorktreeValues
    /\ lastError \in ErrorValues
    /\ githubSynced \in BOOLEAN

\* BoundedCounters: counters never exceed their maximums by more than 1
\* (they can reach max and then a transition fires before the guard blocks)
BoundedCounters ==
    /\ mergeAttempts <= MAX_MERGE_ATTEMPTS + 1
    /\ recoveryAttempts <= MAX_RECOVERY_ATTEMPTS + 1

\* TransientStateInvariant: transient states are never observable
\* (fix_completed and resolved are skipped atomically via chains)
TransientStateInvariant ==
    /\ state /= "fix_completed"
    /\ state /= "resolved"

\* MergeConflictReachability: merge_conflict is only reachable from merging
\* (This is not an invariant per se, but validates the lifecycle structure.
\*  The only action that sets state to merge_conflict is MergeConflict,
\*  which requires state = "merging".)

\* KanbanConsistency: if merged, kanban must be "x"
KanbanMergedConsistency ==
    state = "merged" => kanban = "x"

\* KanbanFailedConsistency: if permanently failed (kanban "*"), state is failed
KanbanFailedConsistency ==
    kanban = "*" => state = "failed"

\* =========================================================================
\* Cross-Module Invariants (Quick Win #4)
\* These validate consistency between effect-state and lifecycle state
\* =========================================================================

\* ConflictQueueConsistency: if in conflict queue, state must be conflict-related
\* Exception: crash can leave inConflictQueue TRUE with state unchanged
\* Also, recovery from failed while in conflict queue can go to needs_fix
ConflictQueueConsistency ==
    inConflictQueue => state \in {"merge_conflict", "needs_resolve",
                                   "needs_multi_resolve", "resolving",
                                   "fixing", "merging", "failed", "needs_fix"}

\* WorktreeStateConsistency: worktree should be present when worker is active
WorktreeStateConsistency ==
    /\ (state = "none" /\ worktreeState = "absent") \/
       (state \in {"merged"} /\ worktreeState \in {"absent", "cleaning"}) \/
       (state \notin {"none", "merged"})

\* ErrorStateConsistency: lastError reflects the failure mode
ErrorStateConsistency ==
    /\ (lastError = "merge_conflict" => 
        state \in {"merge_conflict", "needs_resolve", "needs_multi_resolve", 
                   "resolving", "failed", "merging"})
    /\ (lastError = "rebase_failed" => state = "failed")
    /\ (lastError = "hard_fail" => state = "failed")

\* MergedCleanupConsistency: merged state should trigger cleanup
\* (worktree should be cleaning or absent when merged)
MergedCleanupConsistency ==
    state = "merged" => worktreeState \in {"absent", "cleaning"}

\* ConflictQueueClearedOnResolve: after successful resolution, queue is cleared
\* (This is enforced by ResolveSucceeded setting inConflictQueue = FALSE)
\* Invariant: if state returned to needs_merge from resolving, queue should be empty
\* Note: Not a strict invariant due to crash semantics, but useful for checking.

\* =========================================================================
\* Liveness Properties (require fairness)
\* =========================================================================

\* EventualTermination: every worker eventually reaches merged or failed
\* NOTE: Requires fairness (WF) to hold. Apalache --temporal does not enforce
\* fairness ("Handling fairness is not supported yet!"), so this property
\* can only be verified with TLC. Kept here for documentation and TLC use.
EventualTermination == <>(state \in TerminalStates)
