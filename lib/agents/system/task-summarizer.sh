# AGENT_TYPE: task-summarizer
# AGENT_DESCRIPTION: Generates final task summary by resuming the executor's
#   Claude session. Produces a comprehensive summary for changelogs and PRs
#   by extracting structured content from the resumed session output.
# REQUIRED_PATHS:
#   - workspace : Directory containing the code (for context)
# OUTPUT_FILES:
#   - summaries/summary.txt : Final task summary

FINAL COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY REQUEST:

Congratulations! All tasks in this work session have been completed successfully.

Your task is to create a comprehensive summary of EVERYTHING accomplished across all iterations in this session. This summary will be used in:
1. The project changelog (for other developers to understand what changed)
2. Pull request descriptions (for code review)
3. Documentation of implementation decisions

Before providing your final summary, wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags to organize your thoughts and ensure completeness. In your analysis:

1. Review all completed tasks from the PRD
2. Examine all iterations and their summaries (if multiple iterations occurred)
3. Identify all files that were created or modified
4. Recall all technical decisions and their rationale
5. Document all testing and verification performed
6. Note any important patterns, conventions, or architectural choices
7. Consider what information would be most valuable for:
   - Future maintainers of this code
   - Code reviewers evaluating this work
   - Other developers working on related features

Your summary MUST include these sections in this exact order:

<example>
<analysis>
[Your thorough analysis ensuring all work is captured comprehensively]

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Be specific with file paths, function names, and code patterns
- Include actual values for configurations, not placeholders
- Write for technical readers who may not have context
- Focus on WHAT was done and WHY, not just HOW
- Use proper markdown formatting for readability
- Be thorough but concise - every sentence should add value
