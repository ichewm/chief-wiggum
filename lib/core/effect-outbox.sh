# effect-outbox.sh - Durable effect tracking for crash-safe transitions
#
# Implements an "outbox pattern" for lifecycle effects. Before executing effects,
# record them as pending; after successful execution, mark complete. On restart,
# replay any pending effects to achieve eventual consistency.
#
# This addresses the TLA+ model's identification of mid-transition crash windows
# where state is updated but effects are not applied (MidCrashMergeSucceeded,
# MidCrashMergeConflict, MidCrashFixPass).
#
# File: worker_dir/pending-effects.json
# Format:

#     {"id": "uuid", "effect": "sync_github", "args": [...], "recorded_at": "..."}
#   ],
#   "completed": ["uuid1", "uuid2"]
