# Safely wait for a process and capture its exit code
#
# Under set -e, bare `wait "$pid"` will kill the calling script if the
# process exited non-zero. This helper captures the exit code safely.
#
# Args:
#   pid - Process ID to wait for
#
# Returns: Exit code of the waited process (echoed to stdout)
# Exit: Always 0 (to not trigger set -e)
#
# Usage:
#   exit_code=$(wait_safe "$pid")
#   # OR
#   local exit_code=0
#   wait_safe_var exit_code "$pid"

# Wait for process and store exit code in named variable
#
# More efficient than command substitution when you already have a variable.
#
# Args:
#   var_name - Name of variable to store exit code
#   pid      - Process ID to wait for
#
# Usage:
#   local exit_code=0
#   wait_safe_var exit_code "$pid"

# Kill a process safely, ignoring errors if already dead
#
# Args:
#   pid    - Process ID to kill
#   signal - Signal to send (default: TERM)
#
# Returns: 0 always (safe to use in set -e context)

# Wait for main process and cleanup watchdog/timeout process
#
# Common pattern: main process with a watchdog. Wait for main,
# then kill and wait for watchdog.
#
# Args:
#   main_pid    - Main process to wait for
#   watchdog_pid - Watchdog/timeout process to cleanup
#
# Returns: Exit code of main process (echoed)

# Run a command capturing its exit code without triggering set -e
#
# Args:

# More efficient for inline use without subshells.
#
# Args:
#   var_name - Name of variable to store exit code
